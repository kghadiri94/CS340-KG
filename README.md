How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
#CRUD is very helpful when working within databases and will definitely be utiilized in that area in the future. Since databases are constantly Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting items, CRUD will be very useful.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
#Taking one step at a time and going over the customers requests first then once again while you are creating the application. I also like to utilize the debugger to isolate any potential mistakes within the code.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
#Computer scientists create and maintain code that is utilized for or by programs to elevate their proformance. In this case, the program created for Grazioso Salvare was created to help them maintain their databases more efficiently.
